        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: December 8, 2022</em></p>

        <h2>GENERAL</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy is intended to give you confidence in the privacy and security of the personal information we obtain from you whether you are browsing our website or submitting a case inquiry. This privacy policy governs our collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information in connection with your use of our website(s) on which this Privacy Policy is linked ('Sites'), such as plmprivacypolicy.com.</p>
        
        <p>Please carefully read this privacy policy, which is part of our Terms of Use, before using our Sites. If you do not agree with our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy, you must refrain from using our Sites. By accessing our Sites, you agree to our use of your information consistent with our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We may ask you to provide us with personal information when you use the Sites, submit a case inquiry, and at other times. You are not required to provide us your personal information; however, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Sites or we may not be able to fulfill your requested interaction. The information we may ask you to provide includes your name, address, email address, telephone number, and other information you may voluntarily provide on online forms or the Sites' chat feature.</p>
        <p>We automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on the Sites. For example, each time you visit our website, we may collect the type of web browser you use, the type of device you use, the type of your operating system, the name of your Internet Service Provider, the pages you view on our Sites, referring and exit pages, the date and time of your visit, and the number of clicks to, from, and within the Sites, and the duration of your visits to the Sites. If this information is reasonably capable of being associated with you, we treat it as Personal Information.</p>
        <p>We collect information using cookies (a small text file placed on your computer) and other automated tools such as tracking pixels to improve the experience of the Sites. Many web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can change your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Instructions for how to manage cookies in popular browsers are available at: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari (iOS), Safari (Mac), and Opera. However, certain features of the Sites may not work properly if you delete or disable cookies.</p>

        <h2>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We use personal information to allow us to answer your questions and find a matching provider for your potential case. We do not use it for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. By submitting an online case review through our online forms or live chat, you are directing us to disclose your personal information to our third-party legal partners to determine if you have a viable claim or lawsuit. These third-party legal partners may contact you directly to request additional information or seek to retain you in connection with your potential legal claims or lawsuit. If you do not want your personal information shared with our legal partners, please do not submit a request for a case evaluation on the Sites.</p>
        <p>We may also establish a relationship with other businesses to provide services to us including: to provide the Site; IT and network administration, such as data storage and management, website hosting, data security, and mobile application development; professional services such as legal and accounting, and obtaining legal records.</p>

        <h2>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
        <p>If you are a resident of California, you may opt-out of having your Personal Information shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please let us know by sending us an email at info@plmprivacypolicy.com.</p>

        <h2>SECURITY</h2>
        <p>All security on our Websites is treated seriously. Where applicable, we undertake security steps, including use of SSL technology, on our back-end systems that store customer account information and to protect data transmissions. However, this is not a guarantee that such data transmissions cannot be accessed, altered or deleted due to firewall or other security software failures.</p>

        <h2>COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT</h2>
        <p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose personal information and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our sole discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate to respond to legal requests (including court orders, investigative demands, and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property, or rights of ourselves, consumers, or any other third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with law.</p>

        <h2>OTHER TRANSFERS</h2>
        <p>We may share personal information with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with us. If we are merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer personal information in connection with such transaction.</p>

        <h2>CALIFORNIA 'DO NOT TRACK' DISCLOSURE</h2>
        <p>'Do Not Track' is a web browser privacy preference that causes the web browser to broadcast a signal to websites requesting that a user's activity not be tracked. Currently, our Sites do not respond to 'Do Not Track' signals.</p>

        <h2>POLICY CHANGES</h2>
        <p>Changes in this policy will be posted on our Sites. You are advised to check our Sites regularly to view our most recent privacy policy.</p>
